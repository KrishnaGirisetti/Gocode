Jenkins is a widely used tool for continuous integration and delivery. It allows you to automate different stages of your delivery pipeline. To modify a file stored in a Google Cloud Storage Bucket via a Jenkins pipeline, you can follow the steps below:

1. Install GCloud SDK on Jenkins Server:</strong> The first step is to ensure that Google Cloud SDK is installed on the server where Jenkins is running. Google Cloud SDK includes the gsutil tool, which you will use to interact with Google Cloud Storage. You can install it using the package manager of your OS or download it from the Google Cloud SDK website.</li></ol>

2. Authenticate Jenkins to Google Cloud:</strong> After installing the SDK, you will need to authenticate Jenkins to Google Cloud. This can be done by creating a service account in the Google Cloud Console and giving it the necessary permissions. Download the JSON key file for this service account and use the following command to authenticate:</li></ol><p><pre><div><code>```
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=PATH_TO_KEY_FILE
```
</code></div></pre></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Create a Jenkins Pipeline:</strong> Now, you can create a Jenkins pipeline that will modify the file. You can use the <code>sh</code> or <code>bat</code> step in your pipeline script to execute shell commands. The following is an example of a pipeline that downloads a file from a Google Cloud Storage Bucket, modifies it, and then uploads it back to the bucket:</li></ol><p><pre><div><code>```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Modify file in GCS') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    # Download the file
                    gsutil cp gs://my-bucket/my-file.txt .
</code></div></pre><pre><div><code>                    # Modify the file
                    echo "New content" &gt;&gt; my-file.txt
</code></div></pre><pre><div><code>                    # Upload the file back to the bucket
                    gsutil cp my-file.txt gs://my-bucket/my-file.txt
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</code></div></pre><pre><div><code>In this script, replace `gs://my-bucket/my-file.txt` with the path to your file in the Google Cloud Storage Bucket. Replace `"New content"` with the changes you want to make to the file.
</code></div></pre>
Please note that this is a basic example. Depending on your use case, you may need to install additional tools on your Jenkins server to modify the file. For example, if the file is a JSON file, you may want to use a tool like <code>jq</code> to modify it.</p><p>Also, ensure to handle the credentials securely. The best practice is to use Jenkins credentials binding plugin to securely handle the credentials.</p>
